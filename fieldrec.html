                    <p>The late evening of this day in 2025 will mark the peak of the maybug (cockchafer) flight in northern Germany.</p>
The sheer number of maybugs was already immense in 2024, and seems to be at a similarly high level this year too.
The late evening was particularly striking for about a good hour. I noticed this loud buzzing and droning by chance when I let the cats out of the house. Maybugs were everywhere! There must have been thousands on the property alone. The crowns of the oak trees were teeming; there was scratching and buzzing everywhere. 
                    While setting up the microphones right on the bank of the pond, under the oak trees and a large beech, two maybugs already collided with me.
<p>In the first five minutes or so of the recording, a rather mysterious incident occurred: First, you can hear the tomcat lapping water at the pond, and shortly thereafter, two sounds that cats make during fights or when annoyed. A moment later, something rustles on the embankment, followed by loud footsteps in the gravel where the microphone stand was also positioned.
Unfortunately, I can't say for sure what it was, as I was comfortably sitting in front of the TV at the time. Probably a deer, perhaps a Sasquatch.</p>

                    This May 1st, 2025, will be well remembered for its sunny and warm weather. Towards evening, the light southwesterly wind died down completely.
I set off for Stapeler Moor, a former peat extraction area between Friesland and East Frisia. With little wind and a favorable wind direction, the nearby wind turbines are not, or barely, audible.
On this day, a wonderful soundscape revealed itself. The call of the cuckoo was joined by tree pipits, redshanks, willow warblers, and little ringed plovers.
The attentive listener will notice the high-pitched whirring in this recording. It's a huge swarm of mosquitoes, which, about a meter above the crown of the nearby pine tree, was likely heralding the start of the mosquito season.
Sheep can be heard repeatedly in the background. These are Heidschnucken, small moor sheep that graze on the periphery of the moorland. They are protected around the clock by wolfdogs. The wolf has returned to this region in the last five years or so.
Stapeler Moor, together with Lengener Meer, Spolsener Moor, and Herrenmoor, forms a contiguous protected landscape area (Landschaftsschutzgebiet) in the border region of the districts of Friesland, Leer, Wittmund, and Ammerland. In the generally densely populated Northwest, it is considered one of the most remote areas.
Nevaton MC59 Omni, AB 50. Listening with high quality headphones is recommended.

                    This recording was actually intended more as a test for my new Nevaton MC 59 microphones with a wide cardioid pattern.
Ultimately, this recording turned out to be a small stroke of luck.
Towards early evening, I headed to the eastern part of the Hopelser Forest in East Frisia, so that with a westerly wind, I would be at least somewhat shielded from the traffic noise from the neighboring town of Wiesmoor.
The forest was teeming with life; many bird species were energetically heralding the spring. You can even hear the harsh call of a fox at the beginning. Also beautiful was the magical rustling of the spruce canopy during the occasional stronger gusts of wind. 
But at 6 PM sharp, another sound drifted through the forest: the church bells from Wiesmoor. They echoed for a long time, like a lingering chord, through the forest as the wind slowly subsided and the birds began their evening song. This combination created a meditative musicality that perhaps even the birds themselves seemed to enjoy. The bells must have rung for at least 10 minutes. The beat frequencies came in waves with the light wind through the forest, while the traffic noise almost completely disappeared. Wonderful!
Nevaton MC59 wide cardioid, NOS 35cm, 90°, angled slightly towards the canopy. Listening with high quality headphones is recommended.

                    <h2>A MIRROR OF ONE | Music And Sound As A Medium For Transcendence (live excerpt)</h2>
                    <p>A Mirror Of One is an attempt at creating music in its purest form. Just a wave of energy, representing everything there is. A sound mirror for self reflection. 
                As the sound wave fades into subconscious bass, the church room and its surroundings reappear into conscious existence and sound louder than ever.
                This performance was part of my final exam for my studies in music design.
                Recorded in Trossingen, St. Martins Kirche in Germany (July 2022).</p>

                    <h2>SOUND MAPS OF NORTHERN GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS | 6 Months Of Field Recording</h2>
                    <p>„You listen to the place, not the sound.“</p>
                    This quote from sound ecologist Gordon Hempton describes very well how field recordings are perceived by us. Unlike composed instrumental music or especially electronic music, which is only placed in an (artificial) space, a sound from outside does not describe the instrument, but very accurately the character of the place including many of its inhabitants at a specific time. This sound is highly complex and contains a huge amount of information.
The work “Sound Maps Of Northern Germany and the Netherlands | 6 Months Of Field Recording” is an extensive documentation of the sounds of the north and the coast during times of very quiet air spaces (COVID-19 flight bans). 
I made recordings on the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog and the East Frisian island of Langeoog for sounds of the sea. Moor and forest recordings were made in Friesland and the Geest regions of Schleswig-Holstein. Time of day, day, season and weather have a huge influence.
The finished 30-minute sound composition reveals a large portfolio for the full spectrum of sonic characteristics. I tried to explore the relationship of anonymous natural white noise vs. distinct, clearly recognizable sound. First introduced by sound ecologist Bernie Krause, I used the parameters „geophony“, „biophony“ and „anthrophony“ to organize my recordings.
In total, I gathered about 600 recordings or almost 100 hours of high quality sound material.
Following this work, various (film) music compositions were created using this source material, mainly oriented towards experimental ambient music under the alias Aron Stadler.
